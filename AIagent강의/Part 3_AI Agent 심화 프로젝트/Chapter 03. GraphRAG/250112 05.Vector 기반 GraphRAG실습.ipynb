Prior\\\\nQFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typ-\\\\nical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we\\\\npropose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private\\\\ntext corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity\\\\nof source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages:\\\\nfirst, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pre-\\\\ngenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a\\\\nquestion, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before\\\\nall partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a\\\\nclass of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range,\\\\nwe show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional\\\\nRAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.\\\\n1 Introduction\\\\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to using\\\\nLLMs to answer queries based on data that is too large to contain in a language model’s context\\\\nwindow, meaning the maximum number of tokens (units of text) that can be processed by the LLM\\\\nat once (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In the canonical RAG setup, the system has access to\\\\na large external corpus of text records and retrieves a subset of records that are individually relevant\\\\nto the query and collectively small enough to fit into the context window of the LLM. The LLM then\\\\nPreprint. Under review.\\\\narXiv:2404.16130v2  [cs.CL]  19 Feb 2025\\\\ngenerates a response based on both the query and the retrieved records (Baumel et al., 2018; Dang,\\\\n2006; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017). This conventional approach, which we collectively call\\\\nvector RAG, works well for queries that can be answered with information localized within a small\\\\nset of records. However, vector RAG approaches do not support sensemaking queries, meaning\\\\nqueries that require global understanding of the entire dataset, such as ” What are the key trends in\\\\nhow scientific discoveries are influenced by interdisciplinary research over the past decade?”\\\\nSensemaking tasks require reasoning over “ connections (which can be among people, places, and\\\\nevents) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively” (Klein et al., 2006). LLMs such\\\\nas GPT (Achiam et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil\\\\net al., 2023) excel at sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Microsoft, 2023)\\\\nand intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023). Given a sensemaking query and a text with an\\\\nimplicit and interconnected set of concepts, an LLM can generate a summary that answers the query.\\\\nThe challenge, however, arises when the volume of data requires a RAG approach, since vector RAG\\\\napproaches are unable to support sensemaking over an entire corpus.\\\\nIn this paper, we presentGraphRAG – a graph-based RAG approach '}\", metadata={'score': 0.8661041259765625, 'nodeLabels': ['Chunk'], 'id': '4:cc688412-d5de-457c-807c-5c2eb8a5af8e:282'}), RetrieverResultItem(content=\"{'embedding': None, 'index': 17, 'text': 'article dataset.\\\\nQuestion Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\\\\nGraph\\\\nRAG\\\\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and\\\\ndigital media.

      "The novelty of this paper lies in its proposal of an adaptive benchmarking procedure that utilizes persona generation to create queries representative of real-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system usage. It introduces the GraphRAG approach, which incorporates a graph index derived from an LLM (Large Language Model) to span nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and covariates (claims) for enhanced domain-tailored summarization and community detection. The evaluation criteria also stand out by leveraging LLMs for assessing the quality of generated answers, employing a comparative approach to measure criteria relevant to global sensemaking, such as comprehensiveness, diversity, and answer relevance, among others. The study applies these methods to different datasets and evaluates the effectiveness using statistical analyses.\n"

Prior work has shown LLMs to be good evaluators of natural language generation, includ-\\\\ning work where LLMs evaluations were competitive with human evaluations (Wang et al., 2023a;\\\\nZheng et al., 2024).

This\\\\ngraph index spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims)\\\\nthat have been detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the\\\\ndataset. Community detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index\\\\ninto groups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both\\\\nindexing time and query time. The “global answer” to a given query is produced using a final round\\\\nof query-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.\\\\ngenerated texts such as “fluency” (Wang et al., 2023a) Some of these criteria are generic to vector\\\\nRAG systems and not relevant to global sensemaking, such as “context relevance”, “faithfulness”,\\\\nand “answer relevance” (RAGAS, Es et al. 2023). Lacking a gold standard for evaluation, one can\\\\nquantify relative performance for a given criterion by prompting the LLM to compare generations\\\\nfrom two different competing models (LLM-as-a-judge, (Zheng et al., 2024)). In this work, we de-\\\\nsign criteria for evaluating RAG-generated answers to global sensemaking questions and evaluate\\\\nour results using the comparative approach. We also validate results using statistics derived from\\\\nLLM-extracted statements of verifiable facts, or “claims.”\\\\n3 Methods\\\\n3.1 GraphRAG Workflow\\\\nFigure 1 illustrates the high-level data flow of the GraphRAG approach and pipeline. In this section,\\\\nwe describe the key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\\\\n3.1.1 Source Documents → Text Chunks\\\\nTo start, the documents in the corpus are split into text chunks. The LLM extracts information from\\\\neach chunk for downstream processing. Selecting the size of the chunk is a fundamental design\\\\ndecision; longer text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction (which reduces cost) but\\\\nsuffer from degraded recall of information that appears early in the chunk (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu\\\\net al., 2023). See Section A.1 for prompts and examples of the recall-precision trade-offs.\\\\n3.1.2 Text Chunks → Entities & Relationships\\\\nIn this step, the LLM is prompted to extract instances of important entities and the relationships\\\\nbetween the entities from a given chunk. Additionally, the LLM generates short descriptions for the\\\\nentities and relationships. To illustrate, suppose a chunk contained the following text:\\\\n4\\\\nNeoChip’s (NC) shares surged in their first week of trading on the NewTech Ex-\\\\nchange. However, market analysts caution that the chipmaker’s public debut may\\\\nnot reflect trends for other technology IPOs. NeoChip, previously a private entity,\\\\nwas acquired by Quantum Systems in 2016. The innovative '}\", metadata={'score': 0.8644866943359375, 'nodeLabels': ['Chunk'], 'id': '4:cc688412-d5de-457c-807c-5c2eb8a5af8e:45'}), RetrieverResultItem(content=\"{'embedding': None, 'index': 7, 'text': ', directness evaluates the concision\\\\nof an answer in a generic sense that applies to any generated LLM summarization. We include it to\\\\nbehave as a reference against which we can judge the soundness of results for the other criteria. Since\\\\ndirectness is effectively in opposition to comprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any\\\\nmethod to win across all four criteria.\\\\nIn our evaluations, the LLM is provided with the question, the generated answers from two compet-\\\\ning systems, and prompted to compare the two answers according to the criterion before giving a\\\\nfinal judgment of which answer is preferred. The LLM either indicates a winner; or, it returns a tie\\\\nif they are fundamentally similar. To account for the inherent stochasticity of LLM generation, we\\\\nrun each comparison with multiple replicates and average the results across replicates and questions.\\\\nAn illustration of LLM assessment for answers to a sample question can be found in Appendix D.\\\\n4 Analysis\\\\n4.1 Experiment 1\\\\n4.1.1 Datasets\\\\nWe selected two datasets in the one million token range, each representative of corpora that users\\\\nmay encounter in their real-world activities:\\\\nPodcast transcripts. Public transcripts of Behind the Tech with Kevin Scott , a podcast featuring\\\\nconversations between Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott and various thought leaders in science and tech-\\\\nnology (Scott, 2024). This corpus was divided into 1669 × 600-token text chunks, with 100-token\\\\noverlaps between chunks (∼1 million tokens).\\\\nNews articles. A benchmark dataset comprised of news articles published from September 2013\\\\nto December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports, technology,\\\\nhealth, and science (Tang and Yang, 2024). The corpus is divided into 3197 × 600-token text\\\\nchunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks (∼1.7 million tokens).\\\\n4.1.2 Conditions\\\\nWe compared six conditions including GraphRAG at four different graph community levels ( C0,\\\\nC1, C2, C3), a text summarization method that applies our map-reduce approach directly to source\\\\ntexts (TS), and a vector RAG “semantic search” approach (SS):\\\\n• CO. Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.\\\\n• C1. Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities\\\\nof C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected downwards.\\\\n• C2. Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-\\\\ncommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected downwards.\\\\n• C3. Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These\\\\nare sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected downwards.\\\\n• TS. The same method as in Section 3.1.6, except source texts (rather than community\\\\nsummaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.\\\\n• SS. An implementation of vector RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the\\\\navailable context window until the specified token limit is reached.\\\\nThe size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across\\\\nall six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context\\\\ninformation used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.\\\\nThe graph index supporting conditions C0-C3 was created using our generic prompts for entity and\\\\nrelationship extraction, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the data.\\\\n8\\\\n4.1.3 Configuration\\\\nWe used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for generating community summaries, community\\\\nanswers, and global answers (explained in Appendix C). Graph indexing with a 600 token window\\\\n(explained in Section A.2) took 281 minutes for the Podcast dataset, running on a virtual machine\\\\n(16GB RAM, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8171M CPU @ 2.60GHz) and using a public OpenAI\\\\nendpoint for gpt-4-turbo (2M TPM, 10k RPM).\\\\nWe implemented Leiden community detection using the graspologic '}\", metadata={'score': 0.863037109375, 'nodeLabels': ['Chunk'], 'id': '4:cc688412-d5de-457c-807c-5c2eb8a5af8e:63'}), RetrieverResultItem(content='{\\'embedding\\': None, \\'index\\': 22, \\'text\\': \\'out being redundant or irrelevant.\\\\nFor example, if the question is ’What are the benefits and drawbacks of nuclear energy?’, a comprehensive\\\\nanswer would provide both the positive and negative aspects of nuclear energy, such as its efficiency,\\\\nenvironmental impact, safety, cost, etc. A comprehensive answer should not leave out any important points\\\\nor provide irrelevant information.

For each question and metric, the winning condition received a score of 100, the losing\\\\ncondition received a score of 0, and in the event of a tie, each condition was scored 50. These scores\\\\nwere then averaged over five evaluation runs for each condition. Results of Shapiro-Wilk tests in-\\\\ndicated that the data did not follow a normal distribution. Thus, non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon\\\\nsigned-rank tests) were employed to assess the performance differences between pairs of condi-\\\\ntions, with Holm-Bonferroni correction applied to account for multiple pairwise comparisons. The\\\\ncorrected p-values that indicated statistically significant differences are highlighted in bold.\\\\nPodcast Transcripts News Articles\\\\nCondition 1 Condition 2 Mean 1 Mean 2 Z-value p-value

      "t al., 2024; Shin et al., 2024). Our adaptive benchmarking procedure uses persona\\ngeneration to create queries that are representative of real-world RAG system usage. Specifically,\\nour approach uses the LLM to infer the potential users would use the RAG system and their use\\ncases, which guide the generation of corpus-specific sensemaking queries.\\n2.4 RAG evaluation criteria\\nOur evaluation relies on the LLM to evaluate how well the RAG system answers the generated ques-\\ntions. Prior work has shown LLMs to be good evaluators of natural language generation, includ-\\ning work where LLMs evaluations were competitive with human evaluations (Wang et al., 2023a;\\nZheng et al., 2024). Some prior work proposes criteria for having LLMs quantify the quality of\\n3\\nSource Documents\\nText Chunks\\ntext extraction\\nand chunking\\nEntities & Relationships\\ndomain-tailored\\nsummarization\\nKnowledge Graph\\ndomain-tailored\\nsummarization\\nGraph Communities\\ncommunity\\ndetection\\nCommunity Summaries\\ndomain-tailored\\nsummarization\\nCommunity Answers\\nquery-focused\\nsummarization\\nGlobal Answer\\nquery-focused\\nsummarization\\nIndexing Time Query TimePipeline Stage\\nFigure 1: Graph RAG pipeline using an LLM-derived graph index of source document text. This\\ngraph index spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims)\\nthat have been detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the\\ndataset. Community detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index\\ninto groups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both\\nindexing time and query time. The “global answer” to a given query is produced using a final round\\nof query-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.\\ngenerated texts such as “fluency” (Wang et al., 2023a) Some of these criteria are generic to vector\\nRAG systems and not relevant to global sensemaking, such as “context relevance”, “faithfulness”,\\nand “answer relevance” (RAGAS, Es et al. 2023). Lacking a gold standard for evaluation, one can\\nquantify relative performance for a given criterion by prompting the LLM to compare generations\\nfrom two different competing models (LLM-as-a-judge, (Zheng et al., 2024)). In this work, we de-\\nsign criteria for evaluating RAG-generated answers to global sensemaking questions and evaluate\\nour results using the comparative approach. We also validate results using statistics derived from\\nLLM-extracted statements of verifiable facts, or “claims.”\\n3 Methods\\n3.1 GraphRAG Workflow\\nFigure 1 illustrates the high-level data flow of the GraphRAG approach and pipeline. In this section,\\nwe describe the key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\\n3.1.1 Source Documents → Text Chunks\\nTo start, the documents in the corpus are split into text chunks. The LLM extracts information from\\neach chunk for downstream processing. Selecting the size of the chunk is a fundamental design\\ndecision; longer text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction (which reduces cost) but\\nsuffer from degraded recall of information that appears early in the chunk (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu\\net al., 2023). See Section A.1 for prompts and examples of the recall-precision trade-offs.\\n3.1.2 Text Chunks → Entities & Relationships\\nIn this step, the LLM is prompted to extract instances of important entities and the relationships\\nbetween the entities from a given chunk. Additionally, the LLM generates short descriptions for the\\nentities and relationships. To illustrate, suppose a chunk contained the following text:\\n4\\nNeoChip’s (NC) shares surged in their first week of trading on the NewTech Ex-\\nchange.
